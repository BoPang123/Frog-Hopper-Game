Game Rules
The rules of the game are very simple.
- The game board consists of one red frog, some number of green frogs and 13 pads.
- The frogs are placed on the pads at the start of the game in positions defined by a level card.
There are 40 level cards in total, with varying levels of difficulty.
- The player can move one frog at a time. Frogs can jump horizontally, vertically or diagonally,
but may only be moved onto a pad. Two frogs may NOT share the same pad.
- A frog can only jump to a different pad if they jump OVER another frog onto an empty pad.
When this happens, the frog that was jumped over is removed from the game board.
- The player wins if (and only if) the red frog is the only frog on the board. (i.e. all green frogs
have been removed).
